This project is a e-commerce full-stack aplication based on node.js, express.js and MariaDB, with the ORM sequelize on the back.
The back-end already features pagination and sorting of the product array based on the attribute of the object of your choosing. 

The front is made with react.js, react-router, react-query, and styled components. 

In the next months i will be adding to the front: pagination, product sorting and superUser page.

In the Back i will be adding correct error-handling.
